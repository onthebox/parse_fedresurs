### Fedresurs.ru parser

This script was made to help a friend of mine with his job. 
The script searchs company by passed INN code and returns .xlsx file with contracts data that was concluded in the specified time range.

The script was made hastily and basically is a mess and works slow, but works (!). 

To make things work fill INN codes in ```INN to parse.txt``` and run the ```scrapper.py``` through the CLI.
